Hey there!!

I’m a Machine Learning and AI Engineer, currently working at **Hexacluster**. I have a **B.Tech in Computer Science** and a **Diploma in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras**.

I started my journey with a strong focus on **AI/ML engineering**, but over time I’ve also explored **backend development**, **GitOps**, and other aspects of modern software engineering. I enjoy understanding how different layers of technology connect — from data to deployment.

This site isn’t meant to be a portfolio or a showcase — it’s simply a **personal space to document my learnings, experiments, and notes**. I built it so I can revisit concepts, track progress, and reflect on how my understanding evolves over time.

If you’ve somehow found this site — welcome! Feel free to explore, and maybe you’ll find something useful or interesting along the way.
