If you're starting a research project, you've probably heard the term "literature review." So, what is it, really? I have read some good share to learn about what is literature review alone. This document is a notes I took while I read about it. It might not be very detailed but it will give you a general idea.

At its core, a literature review is an organized summary and critical discussion of all the published information (think articles, books, and conference papers) on a specific topic. It’s not just a list; it’s a story you tell about the research that already exists.

## How it helps

Doing a proper literature review is a foundational step for any serious research project. Here’s why it's so crucial

- **To gain familiarity** : It's the fastest way to get a deep understanding of the current state of knowledge in your field.
- **Find the Gaps**: By seeing what's already been done, you can spot what hasn't. This is the "research gap"—your golden opportunity to contribute something new.
- **Justify Your Work**: It proves that your research isn't just repeating what someone else has done. It builds on the existing conversation and adds a new piece to the puzzle.

## Taxonomy

1. **Narrative (chronological)**:A Narrative Review provides a broad overview or summary of research on a particular topic.
2. **Systematic Literature Review**: Its purpose is to find, evaluate, and summarize all the existing research relevant to a clearly defined question — in a way that is methodical, transparent, and reproducible.
3. **Scoping review**: It is used when researchers want to map the existing research landscape on a topic — to find out what has been studied, how it has been studied, and where the gaps in knowledge are — rather than to answer a narrowly defined question.
4. **Meta Analysis**: a meta-analysis statistically combines the results of those studies to produce a numerical summary or overall effect estimate.
5. **Critical Review:** Moves beyond summary to offer a deep, critical evaluation of the strengths, weaknesses, theoretical assumptions, and methodological rigor of existing research, often proposing an alternative conceptualization.   
6. **State-of-the-Art Review**: Focuses specifically on the most recent publications to provide a snapshot of the current cutting edge of a research topic, highlighting current trends and areas of active investigation.   


## Anatomy

### Formulating and scoping
1. **Define a Clear Topic and Research Question**, The question should be specific enough to be answerable within the scope of the review
2. **Establish the Scope** - Time period of publications to be included, target publishers, any other filters applicable.
3. **Develop a List of Keywords:** Begin with a brainstormed list of keywords and their synonyms related to the core concepts of the research question.

### Literature Search and Acquisition
1. **Systematic Searching** Use the developed keywords
2. **Citation Mining**: when you find a perfect paper, check its reference list.
	- Backward Snowballing
	- Forward Snowballing
3. **Document and Manage Sources**

### Critical Evaluation and Analysis
1. **Go Beyond Description** critically analyze it
2. **Assess Each Source** For each paper, ask a series of critical questions

### Synthesis and Structuring
1. **Identify Themes, Debates, and Patterns**
2. **Organize Your Findings**
	1. Thematic
	2. Chronological
	3. Methodological
3. **Create an Outline**

### Composition and Refinement
With your outline as a guide, start writing.

## The Literature Review in the AI Research Ecosystem

The world of Artificial Intelligence research moves at lightning speed. This presents unique challenges and opportunities.

- The Challenge of Volume and Velocity
- The Publication Landscape: Unlike many fields, top-tier conferences (like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML) are often more prestigious than journals. Furthermore, many breakthroughs appear first as pre-prints on sites like arXiv.org long before formal peer review.

### Top-Tier Venues for AI Research

|**Rank**|**Venue Name**|**Type**|**Key Focus Areas**|**h5-index**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)|Conference|Core Machine Learning, Neuroscience, Deep Learning|371|
|2|International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)|Conference|Deep Learning, Representation Learning|362|
|3|International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)|Conference|Core Machine Learning, AI Theory|272|
|4|AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|Conference|Broad AI, Symbolic Reasoning, Planning|232|
|5|Expert Systems with Applications|Journal|Applied AI, Knowledge-Based Systems|183|
|6|IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems|Journal|Neural Networks, Learning Systems|165|
|7|Neurocomputing|Journal|Neural Networks, Computational Neuroscience|148|
|8|Artificial Intelligence Review|Journal|AI Surveys, Review Articles|147|
|9|International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)|Conference|Broad AI, Multi-Agent Systems|136|
|10|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)|Journal|Core Machine Learning Theory|130|

### The Role of AI in _Conducting_ Literature Reviews

**Benefits**
- Speed and Efficiency
- Enhanced Discovery
- Bias Mitigation

**Limitations and Cautions**
- Lack of Critical Thinking
- Inaccuracy and "Hallucinations"
- The "Storytelling" Deficit
